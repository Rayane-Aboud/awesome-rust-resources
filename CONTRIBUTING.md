## Quality Standards

To keep this list "Awesome," please ensure your suggestions meet the following criteria:
1.  **Relevance:** The resource must be specifically about Rust or directly related tools (e.g., Cargo, Bevy, Tokio).
2.  **Modernity:** Avoid resources that use deprecated syntax (pre-Rust 2018/2021 editions) unless they offer unique historical value.
3.  **Clarity:** The resource should be well-organized and easy for a learner to follow.
4.  **No Pure Self-Promotion:** We welcome your own blog posts or projects, but they must provide genuine educational value to the community.
